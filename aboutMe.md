Hi! My name is Rebecca. I'm a middle school student who has absolutely no idea how to code and it completely confuzzled* by this stuff. I've created this website because I like writing and oversharing on the internet (*ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈)ꕤ*.ﾟ 
I also want to start posting blogs and plogs because I do like taking pictures! (my storage has been dead since 2021, don't ask how I've survived after...)


You can go and check out my sister's website [Cathy's Website](https://yswcyswc.github.io), where she post interesting bits of her life, work and university!  :DD
