Hi! My name is Rebecca. I've created this website because I love writing and I hope you can enjoy as I share some pieces by me, to you :D
I will post some fragments of my life as a blog as well. If you have any questions, you can contact me through my email, which is at the little icon on the bottom.


Also, you can check out my sister's website [Cathy's Website](https://yswcyswc.github.io), where she post cool and interesting facts about her life at home and at her university, Carnegie Mellon! :DD
