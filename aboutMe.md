Hi! My name is Rebecca. I've created this website because I love writing and I hope you can enjoy as I share some pieces by me, to you :D
Also, I will post some fragments of my life as a blog.

Also, you can check out my sister's website [Cathy's Website](https://yswcyswc.github.io), where she post cool and interesting facts about her life at home and at her university, Carnegie Mellon! :DD
