## Story #1 ~ Rockfall Boulder
--- published 10/01/2024

The villagers of Rockfall lived in fear of the boulder that loomed over their village. Every full moon, the boulder would transform into a monstrous creature with razor-sharp teeth and claws, and descend upon the village to claim a victim. No one knew why the boulder was cursed, or how to stop it. The villagers had tried to move away, but the boulder would always follow them. They had tried to fight back, but the boulder was too strong and fast. They had tried to appease it, but the boulder was too hungry and cruel.
One night, a young villager named Ria decided to end the terror once and for all. She had lost her parents and siblings to the boulder, and she had nothing left to live for. She armed herself with a sword and a torch, and waited for the full moon to rise. She knew she had little chance of surviving, but she hoped to at least wound the boulder and make it suffer.


As the moonlight touched the boulder, it began to change shape. It grew limbs and a head, and its surface cracked open to reveal scales and spikes. It roared and shook the ground, then leaped off the cliff towards the village. Ria ran towards it, dodging its swipes and bites. She slashed at its legs and belly, drawing blood and angering it. She threw her torch at its face, hoping to blind it. The boulder snapped at the torch, but missed. It turned its attention back to Ria, who was now cornered against a wall.
Ria knew she had no escape. She raised her sword and prepared to strike one last blow. She looked into the boulder’s eyes, and saw something unexpected. She saw fear. She saw pain. She saw regret. She realized that the boulder was not evil, but cursed. It did not want to kill, but it had no choice. It was a prisoner of its own fate.


Ria felt a surge of pity for the boulder. She lowered her sword and spoke softly.

“I’m sorry,” she said. “I know you don’t want this. I know you’re suffering.”

The boulder looked at her with surprise and gratitude. It nodded slightly, then opened its mouth wide.

“Thank you,” it said in a raspy voice.

It bit down on Ria’s neck, ending her life quickly and painlessly.

The boulder then collapsed on the ground, its curse broken by Ria’s compassion.

The villagers watched in shock and awe as the boulder turned back into stone, never to move again.

They mourned for Ria, who had sacrificed herself to save them.

They honoured her as a hero, who had slain the monster with kindness.




## STORY 2 - Underwater
--- published 16/02/2024



 Water splashed around my flippers as I sloshed them around in the water. Children were cheerfully squealing. A tangy smell wafted to my nose. The pastel blue sky was threaded with a shade of bleached silver. Gust of wind blew towards the glittering golden beach, made little wild weeds and flowers bob and dance. Waves crashed into the shore, washing away bits of sand and seaweed. That's when I realised that I have put my belongings near the edge of the water. I raced towards it but the splash of a wave and the scraping of my shoes against the crackly shells signalled me that I was too late. I swallowed. There was only one thing I could do. I gulped in a mouthful of air and dived into the never-ending body of crystal coloured water, towards my precious, drenched possessions. Salty water filled my mouth and nose. Coral of every single colour swayed with the current, contrasting the dull, pale sand and pointy rocks. I admired the schools of vibrant fish and caught sight of my bag, floating like a jellyfish near me. I reached out and dragged it effortlessly towards me. It was soaked soft and wilting. But that wasn't all my belongings; I still had more to find. I paused once again to observe the rippling sand and waving algae. I swam on blindly, stopping many times to peer at the nature around me, until I banged into something bulky and colossal. Excitement amplified inside of me. Did I just swim into an one million year old village that was abandoned and flooded? Or maybe a monarch's treasury that has been buried overtime? I hesitantly turned to face the thing I bumped into. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a boat. Moss and rust covered every millimetre of this abandoned ship. I dropped my bedraggled bag, not bothering to watch it sink to the bottom of the ocean. I inhaled and gasped in astonishment, forgetting that I was still in water. Choking on disgusting brackish water, I inspected the area. The coral at the bottom was no longer bright and vivid. Instead, it was mud brown and withering. In fact, every plant was shrivelled up because of the ships's looming shadow, blocking the sunlight. I could've started a disco right there, next to the tarnished boat and the drooping, dead plants. But I didn't. I urgently swam back up to the surface of the ocean full of mysteries and secrets, before my oxygen tank ran out of air. I couldn't wait to start digging around in history books and the internet to find out more about this ship's backstory. I couldn't wait to start boasting to my friends and family about what I discovered!
