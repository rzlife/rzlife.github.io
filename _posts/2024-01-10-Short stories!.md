Story #1 ~ Rockfall Boulder

-published 10/01/2024


The villagers of Rockfall lived in fear of the boulder that loomed over their village. Every full moon, the boulder would transform into a monstrous creature with razor-sharp teeth and claws, and descend upon the village to claim a victim. No one knew why the boulder was cursed, or how to stop it. The villagers had tried to move away, but the boulder would always follow them. They had tried to fight back, but the boulder was too strong and fast. They had tried to appease it, but the boulder was too hungry and cruel.
One night, a young villager named Ria decided to end the terror once and for all. She had lost her parents and siblings to the boulder, and she had nothing left to live for. She armed herself with a sword and a torch, and waited for the full moon to rise. She knew she had little chance of surviving, but she hoped to at least wound the boulder and make it suffer.


As the moonlight touched the boulder, it began to change shape. It grew limbs and a head, and its surface cracked open to reveal scales and spikes. It roared and shook the ground, then leaped off the cliff towards the village. Ria ran towards it, dodging its swipes and bites. She slashed at its legs and belly, drawing blood and angering it. She threw her torch at its face, hoping to blind it. The boulder snapped at the torch, but missed. It turned its attention back to Ria, who was now cornered against a wall.
Ria knew she had no escape. She raised her sword and prepared to strike one last blow. She looked into the boulder’s eyes, and saw something unexpected. She saw fear. She saw pain. She saw regret. She realized that the boulder was not evil, but cursed. It did not want to kill, but it had no choice. It was a prisoner of its own fate.


Ria felt a surge of pity for the boulder. She lowered her sword and spoke softly.

“I’m sorry,” she said. “I know you don’t want this. I know you’re suffering.”

The boulder looked at her with surprise and gratitude. It nodded slightly, then opened its mouth wide.

“Thank you,” it said in a raspy voice.

It bit down on Ria’s neck, ending her life quickly and painlessly.

The boulder then collapsed on the ground, its curse broken by Ria’s compassion.

The villagers watched in shock and awe as the boulder turned back into stone, never to move again.

They mourned for Ria, who had sacrificed herself to save them.

They honoured her as a hero, who had slain the monster with kindness.
