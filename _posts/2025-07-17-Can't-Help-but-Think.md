I've already left the school last year, and last night as I was trying to sleep (ahem insomnia) I recalled every fond memory I had of CGS, and I wanted to write them down as a more blogging sort of thing ૮(˶ㅠ︿ㅠ)ა


Yesterday night I thought of everything I had at CGS, the opportunities, the fun, the happiness, and my silly ahh friends. And even if I only spent two years at this amazing school,
I felt like it was one of the most important pieces of my growth, and it was easy to make friends because we're all stupid little kids. Nowadays, everyone has already formed their own little 
friendship groups, so it's even harder to fit in. At CGS, everyone was friends and like a big family which was really nice for 75% introverted me (-_-;)・・・

I can't help but remember our friend group in year 5 with Lily (bestayy), Katelyn (katieeee) and Sherry (sherr/sherzyyy) and all those times we laughed together and talked about memes and random
stuff that I can't even remember now because it was honestly just so RANDOM (and playing downball lol)! In year 5, everything was so peaceful. No friendship wars, no competitions, no tests, NAPLAN (okay that's not so 
peaceful but sure), camp was the best, and everything was a calm oasis with a lot of new kids and a lot of chances to fit in.

I remember those memes from the good old days, like the Whistle Josh Hutcherson thing ummm ♫⋆｡♪ ₊˚♬ ﾟ. doodoodoodoodoo ♫⋆｡♪ ₊˚♬ ﾟ.... I'M THE BIGGEST BIRDDDDD... One twoo buckle my shooooes three fourrr buckleee some moreeeee five six NIKEEE KICCCKSS wooo

Camp Yarra Junction was the BEST (maybe not as good as y6 camp lemme be honest) but still, we saw cows, did giant climbing things and fed chickens, slept in tents with the greatest tentmates
(Sena and Kristina) and it WAS unfair that Lily and katie could be together but whatever. (◔_◔)🙄... The cabins was so fun with a LOT of people, but I remember Elaine vomited because she choked 
on her water and it was terrifying because she couldn't drink more water. (because she choked on it!) and everyone else had to pretend to wake up when the teacher came hehehe. 

We also went to Ballarat for excursion and I remember Katelyn actually found a (small) piece of gold which was really funny. The workers throw in little pieces of gold to trick lil' kids like us...

Ms Hartung was like the nicest year 5 class teacher (5W) (and she was our teacher yayay). She was so nice! We had these writing portfolios and we printed out writing pieces that we made, and I remember writing a poem about Sherzy (uhm
don't ask how that got approved anyways!) We also wrote a joint writing about the 'Cat's Rebellion' with our lil' friend group and it got so long the teacher forced us to stop writing LOL. We each 
published a part of that and it is actually in the Grammarian 2023!! (I also missed Canberra camp because I was in China, but everyone said it was bad (ᵕ—ᴗ—) so when everyone was writing about 
Canberra I was writing about Disney ;꒪ࡇ꒪)

Year 6 was also good, but everyone didn't really like Mr Hoare (our teacher - 6W), but I thought he was okay. In Year 6, our friendship group kind of just broke apart, but I still had Lily with 
me (like I said, BEstayyyyyy) and we started liking kpop boy bands hehehe (blame Lily she like straykids first) We listened to kpop and watched MVs in class when we where meant to be reading ebooks
with headphones on and stuff hehe (˵ ¬ᴗ¬˵) 

We also started hanging out with da boys (which is kinda random) but being my 75% introverted self, it was still Lily who hung with them first then pulled me in too. To Jennie (jayden), Anita
(adam l), Helen (hugh), Annie (aaron) and LISAAAA (lucas lim) I'M SORRY OKAY/??!! but I do love getting lisa's shoelaces and untying them HAHAHAHAH (っ˘ڡ˘ς)

Year 6 camp was actual legendary!! Apart from surfing (surfing sucks okay) it's damp and salty and the wetsuit just sticks to you and you get sand all over your wetsuit then you get sand all over
you when you try to take it off, and PLUS when you're trying to actually surf, you get blown of the surfboard and it HURTSSS... uhm ok! Year 6 camp was true kpop startplace, and MiaoMiaoBand (MiaoMiaoCRLJ) 
birthplace!! The MEMBERS: Lily, Rebecca, Charles & Jiaxin! Debut: Magnetic (ILLIT) errrrr. We participated in this Gong Show (basically talent show) and WON with Magnetic lol. (and charles dressing
like a girl btw) We learned Nxde and Tomboy by i-dle then disbanded uhhhhhh. BUt the thing is we thought we looked cool and professional while dancing but we just looked like 4 flailing drowning
ducks...ᯣ_ᯣ (and we practiced in a literal carpark) Otherwise camp was so GOOOOOD, our cabin was amazing (lily, me, stella and celine), and NO TENTING HAHHAHHAHAHA

PYPx! kind of my worst nightmare, BECAUSE! 75% INTROVERTTTT!! but! Me and Pheobe kind of just partnered together and we made a book fundraiser/ collection thing, I collected from a library and it
was reaaaaalllly successful! yuhhhh ( ◡̀_◡́)ᕤ
