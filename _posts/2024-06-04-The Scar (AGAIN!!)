Muahaha I'm back, people, with the SCAR but POETRYYYYY!!!




A wound deep in the rural earth,
An effect on an earthquake's birth.
Jagged and wild, it cuts through the land,
A merciless force, too strong to withstand.

The landscape bears the mark of its might,
Cracked and uneven, a sorrowful sight.
Debris scattered, a trail of destruction,
A stark reminder of life's interruption.

In its presence, we see our fragility,
Against nature's unyielding ability.
The Scar remains, years have flown,
A haunting echo in the stone.
