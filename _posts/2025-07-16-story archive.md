### THE SCAR
both blurb & poetry ver.

 The abandoned land, now wild deep, jagged fissure in the earth, a wound left by the violent, merciless earthquake. It cut through the landscape like a knife, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The ground around it was cracked and uneven, and debris littered the area. It was a stark reminder of the power of nature and the fragility of the world we live in. The Scar would remain for years to come, haunting the humans around them in its presence forever.


A wound deep in the rural earth,
An effect on an earthquake's birth.
Jagged and wild, it cuts through the land,
A merciless force, too strong to withstand.

The landscape bears the mark of its might,
Cracked and uneven, a sorrowful sight.
Debris scattered, a trail of destruction,
A stark reminder of life's interruption.

In its presence, we see our fragility,
Against nature's unyielding ability.
The Scar remains, years have flown,
A haunting echo in the stone.
