### THE SCAR
 blurb ver.

 The abandoned land, now wild deep, jagged fissure in the earth, a wound left by the violent, merciless earthquake. It cut through the landscape like a knife, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The ground around it was cracked and uneven, and debris littered the area. It was a stark reminder of the power of nature and the fragility of the world we live in. The Scar would remain for years to come, haunting the humans around them in its presence forever.

###THE HUMANOID ANT

You can say I'm magical, because... well... I can turn tiny, about the same size of an ant, and even smaller! I know,
it's truly amazing! But trouble comes here! I was a bit naughty... I decided to turn into an ant and have a little bit of
fun!

First, I crawled into a nearby ant hill. The entrance was steep. I lost my grip and fell all the way to the rocky bottom
of the hill. Ouch! But I was too excited celebrating my victory than to worry about the pain I got on the side of my
body. After that huge fall, I've landed in the food-storage room! There were little crumbs of bread, corn, fruit,
vegetables and biscuits. It was enough for a King's party feast! I helped myself to the delicious food.

Unfortunately, I was soon discovered. I'm pretty easily recognised since I'm still wearing my shrunk blue T-shirt and
maroon jeans, and I bet you've never seen any ants wearing that! The ants found me stealing and greedily devouring
all their precious, collected food. They chased me out mercilessly. With a lot of effort, I finally stumbled out of the
ant hill, with an angry mob of ants still at my heels. As soon as I got out of that miserable hole, I immediately turned
back into human form. It was great being back as a human!

Next, I decided to prank my teacher. It was fun being an ant for a day! But pranking my teacher was something that
I had wanted to do for all the time I've had been at school. I entered the school gates and set my plan into action! I
crawled up to the empty seat in the classroom. The teacher was in the middle of the role.

"Rebecca?" She called out, scanning the classroom.

"Here! Good morning, miss." I responded, through giggles.

A few shocked murmurs echoed through the crowded classroom.

"Where is she?" most students wondered aloud.

I bit my lip to prevent myself from laughing. It was most peculiar, watching people glance around, surprised and
spooked out at the same time.

"What the...!?"

"Is she even in the classroom?"

"Nope, she's not hiding here."

"Not here either!"

"What if she's a ghost?"

"But she can't be a ghost!"

Cries and gossips traveled travelled through the classroom like lightning. When the bell for lunch rang, students were
pushing out of classrooms and into the hallway, all munching on their food. The students' feet were pounding
around everywhere. It was loud, and blood was pounding in my ears and practically caused bleeding from the
thundering feet. Afraid that I'll I'd be stepped on, I quickly transformed back into my human form again.
"Aha! I knew you were being an ant again! You pesky little child."

Who was that!? I turned around and spotted my teacher! Oh no! I'm going to be in huge trouble since my teacher
literally saw me transform!

"Oh! Uh... hi?" I stammered nervously.

"Rebecca!" My teacher yelled in an evil tone, "You're going to be in ENORMOUS trouble. You were disrupting my
brilliant History class and making all my students confused. Now if everyone fails the upcoming test on Ancient
Rome, I might as well be FIRED! It's time to teach you a lesson!"

But... what lesson was she talking about? I was definitely dreading another boring History class, but it seems
seemed to me that it's it was way worse.

"Abracadabra!" My teacher screamed at me.

I suddenly felt myself shrinking and two antlers sprouting out of my head. Then, I realised my hair was growing
shorter and shorter until I'm I was awkwardly bald. My clothes were getting smaller too, and my body was
gradually turning black. Wait! I'm... an ant!

"Oh my!" I nearly fainted! My teacher was a witch and she had turned me into an ant FOREVER!!

I thought my ability only exists would only exist for one day. In reality, I've been an ant for a long time now thanks
to my teacher. If you ever want to visit me, go to the ant hill on top of the steepest hill around the Uluru. I'll probably
be inside, so pound on the ground. In a million of tiny little ants, if you ever see an ant in a blue t-shirt and maroon
jeans, then remember: that's me, and only me, who got was turned into an ant by her witch teacher because of her
pranks and mischief
