### THE SCAR (written 10 September 2023)
 blurb ver.

 The abandoned land, now wild deep, jagged fissure in the earth, a wound left by the violent, merciless earthquake. It cut through the landscape like a knife, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The ground around it was cracked and uneven, and debris littered the area. It was a stark reminder of the power of nature and the fragility of the world we live in. The Scar would remain for years to come, haunting the humans around them in its presence forever.

### THE HUMANOID ANT 09/01/2024

You can say I'm magical, because... well... I can turn tiny, about the same size of an ant, and even smaller! I know,
it's truly amazing! But trouble comes here! I was a bit naughty... I decided to turn into an ant and have a little bit of
fun!

First, I crawled into a nearby ant hill. The entrance was steep. I lost my grip and fell all the way to the rocky bottom
of the hill. Ouch! But I was too excited celebrating my victory than to worry about the pain I got on the side of my
body. After that huge fall, I've landed in the food-storage room! There were little crumbs of bread, corn, fruit,
vegetables and biscuits. It was enough for a King's party feast! I helped myself to the delicious food.

Unfortunately, I was soon discovered. I'm pretty easily recognised since I'm still wearing my shrunk blue T-shirt and
maroon jeans, and I bet you've never seen any ants wearing that! The ants found me stealing and greedily devouring
all their precious, collected food. They chased me out mercilessly. With a lot of effort, I finally stumbled out of the
ant hill, with an angry mob of ants still at my heels. As soon as I got out of that miserable hole, I immediately turned
back into human form. It was great being back as a human!

Next, I decided to prank my teacher. It was fun being an ant for a day! But pranking my teacher was something that
I had wanted to do for all the time I've had been at school. I entered the school gates and set my plan into action! I
crawled up to the empty seat in the classroom. The teacher was in the middle of the role.

"Rebecca?" She called out, scanning the classroom.

"Here! Good morning, miss." I responded, through giggles.

A few shocked murmurs echoed through the crowded classroom.

"Where is she?" most students wondered aloud.

I bit my lip to prevent myself from laughing. It was most peculiar, watching people glance around, surprised and
spooked out at the same time.

"What the...!?"

"Is she even in the classroom?"

"Nope, she's not hiding here."

"Not here either!"

"What if she's a ghost?"

"But she can't be a ghost!"

Cries and gossips traveled travelled through the classroom like lightning. When the bell for lunch rang, students were
pushing out of classrooms and into the hallway, all munching on their food. The students' feet were pounding
around everywhere. It was loud, and blood was pounding in my ears and practically caused bleeding from the
thundering feet. Afraid that I'll I'd be stepped on, I quickly transformed back into my human form again.
"Aha! I knew you were being an ant again! You pesky little child."

Who was that!? I turned around and spotted my teacher! Oh no! I'm going to be in huge trouble since my teacher
literally saw me transform!

"Oh! Uh... hi?" I stammered nervously.

"Rebecca!" My teacher yelled in an evil tone, "You're going to be in ENORMOUS trouble. You were disrupting my
brilliant History class and making all my students confused. Now if everyone fails the upcoming test on Ancient
Rome, I might as well be FIRED! It's time to teach you a lesson!"

But... what lesson was she talking about? I was definitely dreading another boring History class, but it seems
seemed to me that it's it was way worse.

"Abracadabra!" My teacher screamed at me.

I suddenly felt myself shrinking and two antlers sprouting out of my head. Then, I realised my hair was growing
shorter and shorter until I'm I was awkwardly bald. My clothes were getting smaller too, and my body was
gradually turning black. Wait! I'm... an ant!

"Oh my!" I nearly fainted! My teacher was a witch and she had turned me into an ant FOREVER!!

I thought my ability only exists would only exist for one day. In reality, I've been an ant for a long time now thanks
to my teacher. If you ever want to visit me, go to the ant hill on top of the steepest hill around the Uluru. I'll probably
be inside, so pound on the ground. In a million of tiny little ants, if you ever see an ant in a blue t-shirt and maroon
jeans, then remember: that's me, and only me, who got was turned into an ant by her witch teacher because of her
pranks and mischief

### Rain Cloud's Mistake 09/01/2024

Rain Cloud, the rain cloud did nothing else but float around in the sky, rained when it's needed and did ABSOLUTELY nothing when it's not needed. Here's Rain's daily
timetable, or you can call it a weather fore-cast if you want to.

MONDAY:

Morning: Chill.

Evening: Still hanging around.

Night: Rain.


TUESDAY:

-Rain all day.


WEDNESDAY:

-Still raining all day!


THURSDAY:

-Gets blown away by Wind and Puff

Night: Find my way back home.



FRIDAY:
Morning: Sleep
Evening and Night: Rain



SATURDAY:

-Rain again all day



SUNDAY:

Morning: Take a nap

Evening: Rain for five minutes

Night: Finally a day I can sleep!


On a normal Tuesday, Rain was stressed out, nearly running out of water to dump down at on the lazy humans, when she heard one person complaining about how he hates rain and wished it had stopped, so he could go out and
play Soccer. Others agreed with him. Rain was mad. Really mad.
"Fine! I'll take a break and go on holidays! Then you'll realise how useful I am." Rain hissed. Thunder crackled as
he said this.

"You can't take a break! You are important!" Her boss, Thunder Storm growled.

"Oh yeah? If I'm actually useful, the humans might want to show some gratitude!" She snapped back. Rain packed
her back and headed off. Passing Wind, Puff, Sun, Moon, Star, Glow and many more of their sisters, Rain suddenly
pushed through a whole new world! The ground was cracked and dry.

"Hmmm... This place needs some water!" She thought, and she rained. The animals happily and gratefully licked up
the water. Passing on, she arrived at a farm, where crops aren't weren't growing since its it was too hot. She rained.
Rain travelled past an ice skating rink, but the ground was made out of concrete. People was staring at the rink in
disappointment. Water! She rained again and again, floating past hopeful, helpless towns and countries, lastly
arriving back at her town. Rain was utterly shocked at what was going on.

"Wha- What happened here!?" She gasped in surprise.

"That's your doing." Thunder Storm's deep voice rang from behind her, "You left and no one had water. Everyone
else tried to help but they couldn't since they have their own jobs."

Rain can't believe this was all her fault! The ground was withered and shrivelled. Everyone was panting, heaving
crisp, brittle dead plants into a cart and wheeling them off to a compost land. The compost pile was nearly five
metres tall. Humans were watering crops with the last of their water, or else they would die of starvation.
Blood was pounding in Rain's ears louder than a lion's roar. She was too arrogant, thinking that if people are were
annoyed of with her, she would leave.

"It's time for you to do the right thing!" Thunder roared.

Rain leaked out of her. Humans glanced up and pointed at the little drop expectantly. She rained more. It was time
to fix the mistake she'd made. This time, she didn't feel irritation that she was raining too much, she felt relief and
satisfaction that she was helping, not destroying!
