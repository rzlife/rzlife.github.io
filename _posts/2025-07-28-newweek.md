help i have a APSMO maths thingy on wednesday PLS WISH ME LUCK LORD OF THE SKIES AND OF EVERYTHING (´▽` ʃ♡ƪ)`

(UPDATE wednesday 30/07: i did really bad, I think i only got 2 questions right out of five, and YOU KNOW WHAT IM MAD ABOUT one question was 13, I GOT 14, one question was 42, I GOT 44, and the last question I LITERALLY KNEW HOW TO DO BUT I FORGOT Zs WERE THE SAME HELP-)


lemme explain the last question-

so basically they want you to find how many ways to arrange FUZZY but the two Zs were apart, basically a combinations and permutations problem, AND I LITERALLY JUST LEARNT IT but I forgot Zs were the same and I basically multiplied it TWICE IM SO ANGRY NOOOOO)


bruh RIP this was once an aesthetic selca page but now it's a DEMONIC MATHS PROBLEM. I might post all olympiad APSMO questions before I forget bc I'm gonna leak their stoopid ahh test. ┗|｀O′|┛
