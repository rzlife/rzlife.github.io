Time to try something new! I'll be publishing some of my favourite poetry pieces I wrote, so if you're looking forward to these, make sure to check regularly as they are updated whenever I feel like it :D



#1 - The Cosy Corner 
-published 10/01/2024 


Every word in this 
Safe hideout
Is a thrill
Of excitement  


Every book in this
Cosy corner
Is a spark 
Of knowledge


Every series in this
Comfortable corner 
Is a journey 
Of adventure


Every bookshelf in this
Door for reading
Is an escape 
To Wonderland



#2 - Ocean Beneath the Sky 
-published 10/01/2024


Beneath the sky so wide and vast,
Lies the ocean, deep and unsurpassed.
The ocean’s depth, a secret keep,
The sky’s expanse, where dreams may leap.


Sky’s canvas of infinite blue,
Mirrored by the ocean’s endless hue.
The sky, a sapphire sea, so serene,
Reflects the ocean’s opulent sheen.


The heavens’ song soars so high,
As the ocean’s ode answers in a low, languid lullaby.
A squawk from birds, never confined,
Churning from boats leaving land behind.
