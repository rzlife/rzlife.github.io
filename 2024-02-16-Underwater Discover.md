 Water splashed around my flippers as I sloshed them around in the water. Children were cheerfully squealing. A tangy smell wafted to my nose. The pastel blue sky was threaded with a shade of bleached silver. Gust of wind blew towards the glittering golden beach, made little wild weeds and flowers bob and dance. Waves crashed into the shore, washing away bits of sand and seaweed. That's when I realised that I have put my belongings near the edge of the water. I raced towards it but the splash of a wave and the scraping of my shoes against the crackly shells signalled me that I was too late. I swallowed. There was only one thing I could do. I gulped in a mouthful of air and dived into the never-ending body of crystal coloured water, towards my precious, drenched possessions. Salty water filled my mouth and nose. Coral of every single colour swayed with the current, contrasting the dull, pale sand and pointy rocks. I admired the schools of vibrant fish and caught sight of my bag, floating like a jellyfish near me. I reached out and dragged it effortlessly towards me. It was soaked soft and wilting. But that wasn't all my belongings; I still had more to find. I paused once again to observe the rippling sand and waving algae. I swam on blindly, stopping many times to peer at the nature around me, until I banged into something bulky and colossal. Excitement amplified inside of me. Did I just swim into an one million year old village that was abandoned and flooded? Or maybe a monarch's treasury that has been buried overtime? I hesitantly turned to face the thing I bumped into. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a boat. Moss and rust covered every millimetre of this abandoned ship. I dropped my bedraggled bag, not bothering to watch it sink to the bottom of the ocean. I inhaled and gasped in astonishment, forgetting that I was still in water. Choking on disgusting brackish water, I inspected the area. The coral at the bottom was no longer bright and vivid. Instead, it was mud brown and withering. In fact, every plant was shrivelled up because of the ships's looming shadow, blocking the sunlight. I could've started a disco right there, next to the tarnished boat and the drooping, dead plants. But I didn't. I urgently swam back up to the surface of the ocean full of mysteries and secrets, before my oxygen tank ran out of air. I couldn't wait to start digging around in history books and the internet to find out more about this ship's backstory. I couldn't wait to start boasting to my friends and family about what I discovered!
